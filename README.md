    - For macOS, in Terminal, in the same directory as your executable, you must execute the following command: <br>
    `chmod +x commonkey_extractor && ./commonkey_extractor`
    Then, you must enter the path to your OTP. You can also drag and drop it from Finder or your File Explorer into the Terminal, it will be a path directly to it.
